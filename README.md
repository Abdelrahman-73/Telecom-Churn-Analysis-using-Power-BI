# Telecom-Churn-Analysis-using-Power-BI

This project is part of a Data Analysis course covering Power BI. The goal was to analyze a dataset from "Databel" (a fictional telecom provider) to understand why customers are churning (canceling their subscriptions) and to visualize key insights for stakeholders.
